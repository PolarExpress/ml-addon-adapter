# GraphPolaris Machinelearning API

## Introduction
The GraphPolaris machine learning API is the official API for creating machine learning plugins. These plugins can be published to and installed from the marketplace, and then run inside the GraphPolaris platform.

Too visualise your ML-addon result, you need a visualisation that supports your result data format. For this you can either:
- Make your ML-addon compatible with existing visualisations by returning result data that the visualisations understands.
- Make your own visualisation addon that supports your own ML-addon. For more information on creating your own vis-addon see [link].

Addons in Graphpolaris communicate using protocols. For more information on protocols see [link].
